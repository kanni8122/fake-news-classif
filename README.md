# Fake News Classifier
- The Fake News Classifier project is designed to detect and classify news articles as real or fake using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.
- This project leverages Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK to preprocess text data, extract meaningful features, and build predictive models. 
- By utilizing methods like TF-IDF for feature extraction and implementing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks, the classifier achieves reliable performance in distinguishing authentic news from fake news.
